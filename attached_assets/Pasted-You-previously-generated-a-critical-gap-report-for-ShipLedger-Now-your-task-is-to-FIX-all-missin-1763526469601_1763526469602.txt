You previously generated a critical gap report for ShipLedger.  
Now your task is to FIX all missing stakeholders and workflows according to the deficiencies identified:

==============================
🚨 CRITICAL GAPS TO FIX
==============================

1. INSURANCE STAKEHOLDER (Completely Missing)
- Add Insurance role to the smart contract authorization system.
- Create Insurance.sol (or extend existing contract) including:
  • Policy creation  
  • Claim initiation  
  • Claim validation  
  • On-chain approval  
  • Link insurance events to BillOfLading.sol  
- Add backend models:
  • InsurancePolicy  
  • InsuranceClaim  
- Add REST APIs:
  • POST /insurance/policy  
  • POST /insurance/claim  
  • GET /insurance/policy/:id  
  • GET /insurance/claim/:id  
- Update UI:
  • Add “Insurance” to StakeholderSelector  
  • Policy dashboard  
  • Claims dashboard  

2. FREIGHT FORWARDER (Partially Implemented)
- Add freight forwarder authorization in BillOfLading.sol
- Add backend workflows:
  • Shipment coordination  
  • Document preparation  
  • Handover logs  
- Add APIs:
  • POST /forwarder/coordinate  
  • POST /forwarder/submit-documents  
- Add UI pages:
  • Freight Forwarder Coordination Panel  

3. CUSTOMS & PORT AUTHORITY (Limited Functionality)
Enhance these workflows:

CUSTOMS:
- Add clearance request/approval functions in smart contracts.
- Add APIs:
  • POST /customs/submit-declaration  
  • POST /customs/approve-clearance  
- Add UI:
  • Customs Clearance Dashboard

PORT AUTHORITY:
- Add port arrival, berth allocation, and unloading events.
- Add APIs:
  • POST /port/allocate-berth  
  • POST /port/confirm-unloading  
- Add UI:
  • Port Operations Panel

==============================
🎯 DELIVERABLES REQUIRED
==============================

1. Updated smart contract code (Solidity)
- With new roles, modifiers, events, structs, workflows
- Must remain compatible with the BlockDAG network

2. Updated backend code
- New models, controllers, and routes

3. Updated UI components
- StakeholderSelector now has 7 roles:
  • Shipper
  • Carrier
  • Freight Forwarder
  • Customs Authority
  • Port Authority
  • Trade Finance Bank
  • Insurance

4. Documentation updates
- Update README.md sections for:
  • Stakeholders  
  • Smart contract architecture  
  • API routes  
  • Functional workflows  

==============================
🧠 EXECUTION REQUIREMENT
==============================
Implement these fixes in the MOST ORGANIZED way:

FIRST update the smart contracts.  
THEN update the backend.  
THEN update the UI.  
FINALLY update the documentation.

Do NOT skip steps.
Do NOT summarize — generate full working code and folder structure updates.
