Act as a world-class startup pitch deck writer, technical documentation strategist, and hackathon judge.

### Objective
Rewrite and restructure ONLY the main root-level `README.md` into a clean, concise, modern, investor-grade, hackathon-winning format that quickly communicates value, innovation, feasibility, and technical execution.

### Style Requirements
- Clear, simple, and persuasive — avoid long paragraphs.
- Use modern formatting, icons, tables, diagrams, and section headers.
- Structure for fast skim-reading (judges scan under 30–60 seconds).
- Prioritize clarity over buzzwords.
- Keep the tone confident, innovative, and problem-solving focused.
- NO modification to `/contracts/README.md`.

### Mandatory Section Order (exactly):

### Final Rules
- Return only the updated final `README.md` content.
- Must feel professional, modern, hackathon-ready.
- Judges must understand **value + execution + feasibility** in under 30 seconds.
- Do NOT change or reference `/contracts/README.md`.
