You are a senior blockchain technical writer.

### Task Objective
Using the previously generated ShipLedger Solidity smart contract analysis/summary, create a well-structured `README.md` file **inside the `contracts/` directory only**, without modifying the main project root `README.md`.

### Instructions
1. Retrieve or reference the latest smart contract summary already analyzed.
2. Create a new file at: `contracts/README.md`
3. Populate the file using the following structure:

# ShipLedger Smart Contracts (Contract-Level Documentation)

## 📌 Purpose
(Brief explanation of why the smart contracts exist and what value they provide to ShipLedger's logistics automation workflow)

## 📄 Contract Summary
(Insert function-level and module-level summary generated from the analysis, presented clearly)

## 🔑 Key Features
- (bullet points for major capabilities)
- (security + trust elements)
- (blockchain audit capability)
- (multi-party approval logic)

## 👥 Actors & Access Control
| Role | Permission Level | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| Admin | Full control | Deployment + override |
| Carrier | Limited | Shipment creation / updates |
| Customs | Regulatory | Compliance validation |
| Inspector | Review | Condition verification |
| Insurance | Conditional | Claim + risk evaluation |

## 🔁 Workflow & State Logic
Document lifecycle or state machine diagram description:
`Draft → Pending Approval → Multi-Party Sign-Off → Finalized (Immutable) → Archived / Disputed`

## 🛠 Deployment Notes
- Solidity version and compiler settings
- Dependencies and external libraries
- Testing + migration tools (Hardhat, Truffle, Foundry, etc.)
- Recommended test network settings

## ⚙️ BlockDAG Compatibility Assessment
- Current compatibility result
- Required modifications
- Possible supportive networks
- Upgrade plan

## 📌 Backlog / Next Upgrade
- Tokenization of logistics assets
- Off-chain/on-chain hybrid optimization
- Oracle + IoT verification integration
- Gas optimization refactor

### Expected Output Format
Respond **only** with the full `README.md` file contents — no explanation, comments, or extra text. The output must be ready to paste directly into the file.
